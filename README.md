# change_windows_terminal_background  

Simple python script to swap Windows Terminal background image randomly (the script picks the image randomly from all the images inside a folder/directory).  

A .env file with **BACKGROUNDS_PATH**(path to directory with the background images) and **SETTINGS_PATH**(path to Windows Terminal's **settings.json** file) defined is needed.
